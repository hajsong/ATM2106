	"content": " The great Pacific garbage patch People found a high concentration of plastic debris in the middle of Pacific. Although those plastic debris are small enough not to be visible with naked eyes, the size of this \u0026lsquo;patch\u0026rsquo; can be as big as 700,000 km2, a size of Texas, USA.\nWhy is there a garbage patch in the middle of Pacific ocean where no human habitats are nearby? Arctic / Antarctic sea ice trend Under the changing climate, Arctic sea-ice and Antarctic sea-ice show very different trend. While Arctic sea-ice extent has been shrinking over the past few decades, Antarctic sea-ice extend shows the increasing trend.\nHow can we explain this?\nHurricane In the 2017, Atlantic hurricane season was one of the most destructive hurricane seasons on record.\nLots of people suffered from floods and wind damages caused by hurricane, and we even saw a high number of death toll.\nIs this something to do with global warming? Sea level rise Tide gauges and satellite observations revealed the global rising sea level trend, and the recent study finds that it has been accelerating in the last decade. (Link)\nThe sea level trend is quite variable in space with a striking positive trend in the western Pacific. What drives this spatial pattern of the sea level trend? (Mean sea level (MSL) trend estimated from the satellite observations.) Ozone hole The use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) caused to ozone loss that impacts back to human by allowing more ultraviolet (UV) light.\nAnother important impact from the ozone hole is the ability to alter the atmospheric circulation.\nThe stratosphere becomes cooler when UV light is not absorbed as much as it was with more ozone. This results in larger temperature difference between equator and south pole. How does this change the climate in the Southern Hemisphere? CO2 flux Approximately 25% of anthropogenic CO2 has been taken up by the ocean. However, this does not mean that the ocean always takes up CO2 from the atmosphere.\nFor example, the mean air-sea CO2 map reveals that the ocean emits CO2 in the eastern Pacific as well as in the region south of 60 degree S in the Southern Ocean.\nWhat determines this spatial patterns? Your own projects You can choose the subject of the project. Possible subjects are\n Extreme weather events (flood, drought, \u0026hellip;) Fukushima nuclear power plant accident East Asia monsoon \n"

	"content": " Atmosphere-Ocean interaction  Course Description The atmosphere and ocean control the earth climate system by transporting energy, heat, momentum and gas, as well as exchanging them across two components. Air-sea Interaction (ATM2106) course examines the influence of atmospheric circulation on the ocean, or oceanic circulation on atmosphere, and tries to understand the climate system based on the circulation of two bodies and their interactions. This course covers the circulation and interactions in low/mid/high latitudes and small/large scales.\nInstructor  Hajoon Song Office : Science Hall #544 email : hajsong@yonsei.ac.kr telephone : 02-2123-2579  Teaching assistant  Namgung Chunil Office : Science Hall #532 email : silvan@yonsei.ac.kr  Class  Science Hall #523 MW 3:00 pm - 4:55 pm  Target students This course may be appropriate for students in the sophomore or junior year who want to gain basic knowledge about the circulation in atmosphere and ocean and the interactions between two bodies.\nThe objective Upon the completion of this course, students will grasp the concept of atmospheric and oceanic circulations in the rotating earth. Then students will explain the current climate patterns and contemporary climate phenomena using the learnings from the classes. This descriptive course also provides an introduction to upper-level classes in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences.\nPrerequisite None\nGrading  Homework : 30% Midterm : 30% Final project : 30% Attendance and participation : 10%  Textbook Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate Dynamics by John Marshall and R.
