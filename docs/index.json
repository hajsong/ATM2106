	"content": "The great Pacific garbage patch  People found a high concentration of plastic debris in the middle of Pacific. Although those plastic debris are small enough not to be visible with naked eyes, the size of this \u0026lsquo;patch\u0026rsquo; can be as big as 700,000 km2, a size of Texas, USA.\nWhy is there a garbage patch in the middle of Pacific ocean where no human habitats are nearby? Arctic / Antarctic sea ice trend  Under the changing climate, Arctic sea-ice and Antarctic sea-ice show very different trend. While Arctic sea-ice extent has been shrinking over the past few decades, Antarctic sea-ice extend shows the increasing trend.\nHow can we explain this?\nHurricane  In the 2017, Atlantic hurricane season was one of the most destructive hurricane seasons on record.\nLots of people suffered from floods and wind damages caused by hurricane, and we even saw a high number of death toll.\nIs this something to do with global warming? Sea level rise  Tide gauges and satellite observations revealed the global rising sea level trend, and the recent study finds that it has been accelerating in the last decade. (Link)\nThe sea level trend is quite variable in space with a striking positive trend in the western Pacific. What drives this spatial pattern of the sea level trend? (Mean sea level (MSL) trend estimated from the satellite observations.) Ozone hole  The use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) caused to ozone loss that impacts back to human by allowing more ultraviolet (UV) light.\nAnother important impact from the ozone hole is the ability to alter the atmospheric circulation.\nThe stratosphere becomes cooler when UV light is not absorbed as much as it was with more ozone. This results in larger temperature difference between equator and south pole. How does this change the climate in the Southern Hemisphere? CO2flux  Approximately 25% of anthropogenic CO2has been taken up by the ocean. However, this does not mean that the ocean always takes up CO2from the atmosphere.\nFor example, the mean air-sea CO2map reveals that the ocean emits CO2in the eastern Pacific as well as in the region south of 60 degree S in the Southern Ocean.\nWhat determines this spatial patterns? Particulate Matter (PM) and seasons It became normal to monitor the air quality before starting the day. The particulate matter (PM) data in the Seoul Metropolitan Area shows an interesting temporal evolution. The PM level has been continuously decreased since 2000 before it starts to go up after 2012. How could we understand and interpret this trend? (Fig. 1 in Kim et al. (2017), Scientific Reports)\nYour own projects  You can choose the subject of the project. Possible subjects are\nPlease get together with your team members and discuss what topic your group want to explore. You can pick any topics above or find your own topic. The assignment of the topic is first-come, first-served bases. If the topic your team want to do is picked up by another team, then your team have to pick something else. Please let me know the topic of your team before the midterm week.\n"

	"content": "Python Python is a programing language that becomes very popular in many areas. The earth sciences field is not an exception. If you want specific reason for the choice of Python in this class, here they are.\n Python has been gaining solid ground in earth sciences community. Python is light, efficient and fast! Python is free!  Python up there.. Python is free and has been distributed in many different ways. One of the most popular and recommended way to obtain it is through Anaconda software distribution, which provides platform-independent package management for Python and other software in self-contained user-specific environments.\nHowever, I want to explore cloud-based python environments like Colaboratory by Google. The main advantage of using online service is that you do not have to spend your time to install Python and configure its setting to be consistent with the one I propose. Also, everyone in the class will be on the same environments so that we are all share how we solve the problem without worrying about whether this will work on other systems.\nI have experienced a clould-based Python environment but not Colaboratory. So I hope that we all get to learn how to efficiently use this platform that, I think, becomes a major trend in computer sciences.\nEnough said. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into Google Colaboratory!\nHow to set up your acount on Google Colaboratory  Create an account (possibly your Yonsei email account works well). Create a new Jupyter notebook. Save it. Check if your saved file is in your Google Drive.  "

	"content": "Course Description The atmosphere and ocean control the earth climate system by transporting energy, heat, momentum and gas, as well as exchanging them across two components. Atmospheric and Oceanic Circulation (ATM2106) course aims to understand the circulation of the air and sea, and the climate system as a whole. This course will use both classical type of lectures and the state-of-the-art computer programming language such as Python to enhance the learning experience.\nInstructor  Hajoon Song Office : Science Hall #544 email : hajsong@yonsei.ac.kr telephone : 02-2123-2579  Teaching assistant  Donghyuk Kim Office : Science Hall #532 email : donghyuk95@yonsei.ac.kr  Class  Science Hall #523 Lecture : Tue 16:00 - 17:50, Thu 14:00 - 14:50 TA lecture : Thu 15:00 - 15:50  Office hours Both Donghyuk and Hajoon will be happy to have office hours by appointment. Please email us!\nTarget students This course is appropriate for students in the sophomore or junior year who want to gain basic knowledge about the circulation in atmosphere and ocean and the interactions between two bodies.\nThe objective Upon the completion of this course, students will grasp the concept of atmospheric and oceanic circulations in the rotating earth. Then students will explain the current climate patterns and contemporary climate phenomena using the learnings from the classes. This descriptive course also provides an introduction to upper-level classes in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences.\nPrerequisite None, but the background in math and sciences is recommended.\nGrading  Homework : 30% Midterm : 30% Final exam (or project) : 30% Attendance and participation : 10%  Textbook Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate Dynamics by John Marshall and R.
