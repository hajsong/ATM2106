Atmospheric and Oceanic Circulation
</h1>

#### Course Description

The atmosphere and ocean control the earth climate system by transporting energy, heat, momentum and gas, as well as exchanging them across two components. Atmospheric and Oceanic Circulation (ATM2106) course aims to understand the circulation of the air and sea, and the climate system as a whole. This course will use both classical type of lectures and the state-of-the-art computer programming language such as Python to enhance the learning experience.

#### Target students
This course is appropriate for students in the sophomore or junior year who want to gain basic knowledge about the circulation in atmosphere and ocean and the interactions between two bodies.

#### The objective
Upon the completion of this course, students will grasp the concept of atmospheric and oceanic circulations in the rotating earth. Then students will explain the current climate patterns and contemporary climate phenomena using the learnings from the classes. This descriptive course also provides an introduction to upper-level classes in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences.

#### Prerequisite
None, but the background in math and sciences is recommended.
